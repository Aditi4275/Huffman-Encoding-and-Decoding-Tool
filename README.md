# Huffman-Encoding-and-Decoding-Tool
This project implements a Huffman Encoding and Decoding Tool in C++ for efficient text compression and decompression. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequency in the input text, ensuring that the most frequently used characters have the shortest codes.
